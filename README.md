# Fortune.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fortunejs/fortune.png?branch=rewrite)](https://travis-ci.org/fortunejs/fortune)

Fortune is a framework for hypermedia applications. It provides a system of database adapters, serializers, and I/O which can be exposed using protocols such as HTTP. A baseline of defaults are included: [Node Embedded Database (NeDB)](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) adapter, [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) serializer, and HTTP `requestListener`.

Get it by installing from `npm`:

```sh
$ npm install fortune
```


### Adapters

Adapters belong to class that must implement a baseline of methods that have well-defined parameters and return values. The adapter could be backed by anything from a text file to a distributed database, as long as it implements the adapter methods. They are responsible for interpreting the options and schemas provided to it.


| Adapter          | Maintainer     | Description                             |
|:-----------------|:---------------|:----------------------------------------|
| NeDB (included, [link](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb)) | [Dali Zheng](http://daliwa.li) | Embedded data store. Default. |


### Serializers

Serializers format data in and out of a Fortune app. Like adapters, they belong to a class that implements a baseline of methods with well-defined parameters and return values. Serializers are responsible for interpreting and displaying media types such as JSON. They may also be concerned with routing requests, though this is optional.

| Serializer       | Maintainer     | Description                             |
|:-----------------|:---------------|:----------------------------------------|
| JSON API (included, [link](http://jsonapi.org)) | [Dali Zheng](http://daliwa.li) | Tracking latest JSON API master branch, useful for clients such as [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data). Default. |


### Input / Output

Internally, Fortune uses a request and response model much like how HTTP operates. Like the adapter and serializer, it also has well-defined parameters and return values. Users of Fortune should not have to care about this layer unless they want to implement how it maps to a protocol or external framework. Using Fortune over a network protocol is optional.

| Implementation   | Maintainer     | Description                             |
|:-----------------|:---------------|:----------------------------------------|
| requestListener (included) | [Dali Zheng](http://daliwa.li) | A bare-bones function that takes `request` and `response` parameters, useful for `http.createServer`. |


### Example

Fortune should work out of the box with no configuration using the defaults. For example:

```js
import http from 'http';
import Fortune from 'fortune';

let app = new Fortune();

app.resource('user', {
  name: String,
  createdAt: Date
});

app.init().then(() => {
  http.createServer(Fortune.Net.requestListener.bind(app))
  	.listen(1337);
});
```


### Philosophy

The earliest concept of hypermedia was a [mechanical device that created trails of links between microfilms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex). It wasn't until 1965 that Ted Nelson [coined the term "hypermedia"](http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=1055) as a digital system of hyperlinks and media. Fast forward to today and we have the world wide web, and along with it, [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), etc. [Hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) provides a fundamental layer of understanding which REST builds upon. RESTful services resemble web pages in that links are present in the media, which a client can discover and follow. This promotes decoupling of server and client, and discovery of new information.

> "REST is software design on the scale of decades: every detail is intended to promote software longevity and independent evolution. Many of the constraints are directly opposed to short-term efficiency." -- Roy T. Fielding

Building hypermedia APIs is hard. If it wasn't hard then everyone would be doing it already. Fortune aims to present simple options for building hypermedia APIs, with most of the hard work done already.

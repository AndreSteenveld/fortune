Fortune is a high-level I/O library for web applications.

[View the website](http://fortunejs.com) for documentation. Get it from `npm`:

```sh
$ npm install fortune@latest --save
```

Currently *beta* software. Things will break, check the [changelog](http://fortunejs.com/changelog/).


## Key Features

- Define record types as the basis for working with persistent data.
- Abstract base classes for implementing data storage and serialization.
- Map to a network protocols such as HTTP and WebSocket.
- Run in a browser as a client-side store (IndexedDB & Web Storage fallback).


## Example

Here is an example server-side application, including a web server:

```js
import fortune from 'fortune'
import http from 'http'

const store = fortune.create()
const server = http.createServer(fortune.net.http(store))
```

This sets up an instance of Fortune with default options, and an HTTP server instance. The `fortune.net.http` module returns a listener function that does content negotiation to determine which serializers to use for I/O, and forwards Node's built-in `request` and `response` objects to the serializers.

```js
store.defineType('user', {
  name: { type: String },
  groups: { link: 'group', inverse: 'members', isArray: true }
})

store.defineType('group', {
  name: { type: String },
  members: { link: 'user', inverse: 'groups', isArray: true }
})
```

Defining record types. There is a many-to-many relationship between `user` and `group` on the `groups` and `members` fields respectively.

```js
store.connect().then(() => server.listen(1337))
```

Finally we need to call `connect` before we do anything with the instance. Then we can let the server listen, which yields a HTTP API that conforms to the [Micro API](http://micro-api.org) and [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) specifications. By default, it is backed by an embedded document store, [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb), which runs in memory by default, but has options to persist to disk.

For the Micro API serializer, we get a set of internal pre-defined routes. Note that by default, the routes are obfuscated to the client, to encourage the use of hypermedia.

| Method   | Route (unobfuscated)  | Description                                                   |
|:---------|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/`                   | Get the entry point including links to collections.           |
| `GET`    | `/:type`              | Get a collection of records belonging to that type.           |
| `POST`   | `/:type`              | Create a record belonging to that type.                       |
| `PATCH`  | `/:type`              | Update records belonging to that type.                        |
| `DELETE` | `/:type`              | Delete an entire collection of records by type.               |
| `GET`    | `/:type/:ids`         | Get records of a type by comma separated IDs.                 |
| `PATCH`  | `/:type/:ids`         | Update records of a type by comma separated IDs.              |
| `DELETE` | `/:type/:ids`         | Delete records of a type by comma separated IDs.              |
| `GET`    | `/:type/:ids/:link`   | Get related records corresponding to a type and IDs.          |
| `PATCH`  | `/:type/:ids/:link`   | Update related records corresponding to a type and IDs.       |
| `DELETE` | `/:type/:ids/:link`   | Delete related records corresponding to a type and IDs.       |

The JSON API serializer emits routes specified [here](http://jsonapi.org/recommendations/).

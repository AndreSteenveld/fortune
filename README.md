# Fortune.js

Fortune is a framework for hypermedia applications. It provides a system of database adapters, serializers, and I/O which can be exposed using protocols such as HTTP. A baseline of defaults are included: [Node Embedded Database (NeDB)](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb), [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) serializer, and HTTP server.

The purpose is to provide an adequate abstraction for a web application server in the same spirit as Rails, Sails, Django, et al. but with a focus on building robust applications using hypermedia.

Get it by installing from npm:
```
$ npm install --save fortune
```

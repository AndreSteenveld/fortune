   * ```
   *
   * The syntax of the `filter` object depends on the specific adapter.
   * The `match` object should be merged with `filter` if it exists, though
   * `match` should take precedence.
   *
   * The syntax of the `sort` object is as follows:
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   "age": -1, // descending
   *   "name": 1 // ascending
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Fields can be specified to be either included or omitted, but not both.
   * Use the values `true` to include, or `false` to omit. The syntax of the
   * `fields` object is as follows:
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   "name": true, // include this field
   *   "age": true // also include this field
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The syntax of the `match` object is straightforward:
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   "name": "value", // exact match or containment if array
   *   "friends": ["joe", "bob"], // match any one of these values
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The return value of the promise should be an array.

   * @param {Array} ids
   * @param {Object} [options]
   * @return {Promise}

   *   // Remove values from an array field. If the value is an array, all of

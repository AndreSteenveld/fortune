# Getting Started

Fortune provides generic features (mostly [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) and [serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization)) intended to be used in web applications, or [*skins around databases*](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1a2mf7/programming_is_terriblelessons_learned_from_a/c8tjzl5) for the haters. The goal is to provide a system for automating data persistence and manipulation given a set of models that conform to [some limitations](https://github.com/fortunejs/fortune/blob/rewrite/lib/index.js#L134-L171). It is intended to be used standalone or composed within Node.js web frameworks (Express, Connect, Hapi, Koa, etc).

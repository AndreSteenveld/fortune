# Getting Started

The first thing you'll have to do is install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if you're on Linux, install `nodejs` from your package manager). Optionally, you will need an ES6 transpiler such as [Babel](http://babeljs.io) to run ES6 code:

```sh
$ npm install -g babel
```

*Note: if the above did not work, you probably don't have permissions, [here are workarounds](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).*

Then install Fortune from the command-line:

```sh
$ npm install fortune
```

Then create an empty `index.js` file next to the `node_modules` folder, and start by importing Fortune and creating an instance:

```js
import fortune from 'fortune'
const store = fortune.create()
```

We don't need to pass any arguments to the constructor for now, the defaults should work.


## Entity-relationship Modelling

The instance must have record types to be useful. Let's start with a basic example:

```js
store.defineType('user', {
  username: { type: String },
  key: { type: Buffer },
  salt: { type: Buffer },
  group: { link: 'group', inverse: 'users', isArray: true }
})

store.defineType('group', {
  name: { type: String },
  users: { link: 'user', inverse: 'group', isArray: true }
})
```

This defines a `user` record type that has a relationship to the `group` type. By default, relationships are to-one, unless `isArray` is specified. In this example, there is a many-to-many relationship between a user and a group. The `inverse` field specifies a corresponding field on the linked type, so that any update to either field will affect the other.


## Transformation

Transformations can be defined per record type. Transform functions accept at least two arguments, the `context` object, the record, and optionally the `update` object for an `update` request. The method of an input transform may be any method except `find`, and an output transform may be applied to all methods.

Here are some implementation details for dealing with passwords:

```js
import crypto from 'crypto'

const [ iterations, keyLength, saltLength ] =
  [ Math.pow(2, 15), Math.pow(2, 9), Math.pow(2, 6) ]

function passwordCheck (password, key, salt) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => crypto.pbkdf2(
    password, salt, iterations, keyLength, (error, buffer) =>
      error ? reject(error) : key.equals(buffer) ? resolve() : reject()))
}

function generateSalt () {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    crypto.randomBytes(saltLength, (error, buffer) =>
    error ? reject(error) : resolve(buffer)))
}

function generateKey (password, salt) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keyLength, (error, buffer) =>
      error ? reject(error) : resolve(buffer)))
}
```

This is a pretty basic implementation using the `crypto` module provided by Node.js to check and generate passwords. For the user type, it would be a good idea to store the password as a cryptographically secure key, and to hide sensitive fields when displaying the record.

```js
const { methods, errors } = fortune

store.transformInput('user', (context, record, update) => {
  const { request: { method, type, meta } } = context
  let { key, salt, password } = record

  if (method === methods.create && !password)
    throw new errors.BadRequestError(`Password must be specified.`)

  return method !== methods.create ? passwordCheck(
    new Buffer(meta['authorization'] || '', 'base64').toString(),
    key, salt.toString()) : Promise.resolve()

  .catch(() => {
    throw new errors.UnauthorizedError(`Incorrect password.`)
  })

  .then(() => {
    if (method === methods.delete) return null
    if (!password) password = update.replace.password

    return generateSalt()
    .then(buffer => {
      salt = buffer
      return generateKey(password, salt.toString())
    })
    .then(buffer => {
      key = buffer
      if (method === methods.create) {
        record.key = key
        record.salt = salt
        return record
      }
      update.replace = { key, salt }
      return update
    })
  })
})
```

Input transform functions are run before anything gets persisted, so it is safe to throw errors. They may either synchronously return a value, or return a Promise. Note that the `password` field on the record is not defined in the record type, arbitrary fields are not persisted. Updating the password in this example requires a field in the `meta` object, for example `Authorization: "Zm9vYmFyYmF6cXV4"` where the value is the base64 encoded old password.

It may be required to transform outputs as well. In this example, we don't want expose the salt and the key publicly:

```js
store.transformOutput('user', (context, record) => {
  // Hide sensitive fields.
  delete record.salt
  delete record.key
  return record
})
```

The output transform has the same arguments as the input transform, but is applied on all requests. Some serializers may not show the resolved value of the output transform for certain requests, such as updating and deleting. It must return the record, either synchronously or as a promise.


## Finishing

To start the application, we need to call the `connect` method.

```js
import http from 'http'

const listener = fortune.net.http(store)
const server = http.createServer(listener)
const port = 1337

store.connect().then(() => {
  server.listen(port)
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}...`)
})
```

Using Fortune with HTTP is optional, but since the built-in serializers provide HTTP functionality in conjunction with the `fortune.net.http` module, it's easy to get started with it. The `fortune.net.http` module returns a listener function that accepts a `request` and `response` object that is generated by Node.js.

Starting the application:

```sh
$ babel-node .
```


Making a cURL request to the server:

```sh
$ curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" -v http://localhost:1337
```

The response should be an enumeration of types. Subsequent requests are templated: `/:type/:ids`. IDs may be comma separated.

It is advisable to use a hypermedia format over the wire, such as [Micro API](http://micro-api.org), there is [a serializer available](https://github.com/fortunejs/fortune-micro-api). Also it would be useful to persist data to disk, consult the [plugins page](http://fortunejs.com/plugins/) for more information.

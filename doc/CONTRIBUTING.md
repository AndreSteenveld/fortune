# Contributing

The [main repository is on GitHub](https://github.com/fortunejs/fortune). Here's what you need to do:

1. Fork it.
2. Install development dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Update files, make sure the code lints and the tests pass by running `npm test`.
4. Commit, push, and submit a pull request.


### What to contribute

Issues are tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/fortunejs/fortune/issues). Beyond submitting code, a few things would be nice:

- Guides on how to use Fortune.
- Changes to documentation are welcome.
- Promotional materials (graphics would be nice).
